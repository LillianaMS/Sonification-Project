# Sonification Project for Undergraduate Research at University of Puerto Rico

Since time series consist of sequences of data points that change over time, and sound can be represented as time series, this investigation intended to use previous works on the matter to find whether using sound to represent relations in a time-series data set could enhance the interpretation of visual representations of data. To experiment with the sonification techniques, we decided to work with low-dimensionality cardiovascular data as a starting point. Using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX), we discretized our data set to create string representations of the data that could be translated into sound.

Documentation on Symbolic Aggregate Approximation can be found at: https://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/sax.htm 

SAX method is being borrowed from the seninp/saxpy github project available at from https://github.com/seninp/saxpy.git
