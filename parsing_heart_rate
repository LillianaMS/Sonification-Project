# Code for parsing our cardiovascular data sets in Ubuntu's terminal. 
# Goal: Having a separate dataset for each patient that contains only two columns (time stamp, hr value)

# Select and copy text from original file to new file "rawHR.txt"
$ cat Raw_bp_data_for_figures.txt | grep BP.HR Raw_bp_data_for_figures.txt >> rawHR.txt

# Copy dataset on new file "rawHR_no_NA.txt"
$ cp rawHR.txt  rawHR_no_NA.txt

# Eliminate "NA" values and copy resulting dataset to new file "rawHR_no_NA.txt"
$ sed -i '/NA/d' ./rawHR_no_NA.txt

# Extract the following columns: patient ID number, time stamps and heart rate value
$ awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$9}' rawHR_no_NA.txt > hr.txt

# Create new directory to store separate files for each patient
$ mkdir patientHR
$ mv hr.txt patientHR
$ cd patientHR

# Create a file for each patient
$ touch hr1.txt hr3.txt hr4.txt hr5.txt hr6.txt hr7.txt hr8.txt hr9.txt

# Extract patient no.1 rows and save on separate file
$ cat hr.txt | grep HCR001 hr.txt >> hr1.txt

# Extract date and hour time stamp, and heart rate
$ awk '{print $2,$3,$4}' hr1.txt > hr_1.txt
